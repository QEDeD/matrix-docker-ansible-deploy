# Support Documentation Contract

This directory is the canonical support layer for agent/operator collaboration.

## Purpose

- Define execution and safety rules for automation-assisted maintenance.
- Provide runbooks that agents can reference without inventing workflow details.
- Keep cross-repo behavior consistent between MDAD and
  MASH where possible.

## Source of truth

- `AGENTS.md` - repository policy guardrails and allowed behavior.
- `docs/ai/agent_workflows.md` - implementation/reporting workflow details.
- `docs/ai/upstream_role_contribution.md` - upstream role/new-role contribution
  workflow and branch hygiene rules.
- `docs/ai/vault-operations.md` - human-run vault workflow and secret-safe output rules.

## Relation to top-level docs

Top-level docs remain user/operator product documentation (for example:
`docs/installing.md`, `docs/just.md`, `docs/playbook-tags.md`,
`docs/uninstalling.md`).

Use `docs/ai/*` for support-process behavior and command construction; use
top-level docs for service/playbook semantics.

For the shared Codex setup:

- repo-local `.agents/skills/**` is optional space for truly repo-specific
  skills if present
- shared custom skills are sourced from `~/codex-support/skills`
- shared custom skills are installed for runtime use via `~/.agents/skills`

## Maintenance rule

Non-repository-specific support rules should remain text-identical across
MDAD and MASH. Divergence should be limited to real
structural differences.
